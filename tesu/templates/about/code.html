            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p class=indented>I was motivated to learn programming as a child because I wanted to develop video games. I learned JavaScript and PHP through library books in 4th grade.
            <p class=indented>In high school, I taught myself C++ for competitive programming and learned Java and Android development in class. An internship introduced me to Ruby on Rails, and I picked up Django for personal projects afterwards.
            <p class=indented>I mostly wrote Python in college, with some C, C++, and Java on the side. I also dabbled in C# for Unity game development. I eventually picked up OCaml during my 2018 internship, and continue to use it at my day job.
