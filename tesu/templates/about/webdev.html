            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p class=indented>I've been a web developer for most of my life. <a href="http://boboclub.webs.com">This</a> is my first website&mdash;it's funny to see what I thought was good web design in 2009. I think my taste has improved since then.
            <p class=indented>I certainly didn't need a web presence as a third grader, but I really wanted one. After getting over that phase, I ran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606185513/http://epicpwnage.co.cc/forums/">my own forum</a>. Other websites I ran in middle school are unfortunately no longer accessible.
            <p class=indented>Eventually, I decided to avoid using PHP for my web applications and switch to pure JavaScript. You can find some examples <a href="/misc">here</a>. I got rid of all PHP usage on this site in <a href="/blog/yet-another-site-redesign">November 2017</a>.
