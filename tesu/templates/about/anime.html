            <p class=indented>I don't watch anime anymore. I stopped watching seasonal anime after 2017, and completely stopped after 2018. I still go to anisong concerts.
            <p class=indented>My favorite anime studio is (was?) Studio Trigger. I'm a huge fan of Kill la Kill, Inferno Cop, and Space Patrol Luluco. I'm also a Type-Moon fan. No love for Fate/Grand Order though, and the Mahoutsukai no Yoru localization came out way too late for me to care.
            <p class=indented>I had a brief stint with fansubbing in 2017. I edited for Chihiro-Fansubs, but quit after two seasons. Fansubbing is dead.
            <p class=indented>I occasionally go to anime conventions (Otakon, Katsucon, Anime Boston, Anime Central, Anime NYC). I typically enjoy their arcade areas; my go-to games include DDR/ITG, Sound Voltex, and jubeat.
